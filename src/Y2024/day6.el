;; ok this sounds challenging
;; the brute force way is of course:

;; for each position: (minus the guard and current obstacles)
;;    play the game
;;    if out of window - no loop
;;    if loop - position makes loop


;; hm.
;; well, you only need to check the positions
;; where it would walk 'in the first place'
;; that was this 4665 number


;; 
;; loop - the moment you reach a pos you already
;; visited, + with the same move direction
;; 



;; 240ms
;; hm, it has 17030 positions

(/ (* 0.240 4665) 60)
;; 18minutes lol
;; I could code it and go for a walk

;; I'll think about this.
;; I hope you liked part 1.

;; I'll do it once in slow mow
